THE PROJECT:
We have two goals; reduce food waste on campus, and connect students to sources of free food as it becomes available, immediately. 
We want to create an app, that can give this information in real time, which is student powered and doesn't rely on moderators 
or staff members for updates.

HSU has a problem: 30% of waste generated is food.  Here's the thing: when we cater events HSU dining must contact the Oh Snap program
when the event is complete.  A clock starts.  Oh Snap has a window to pick up food -- one of their employees must go to this location and 
follow strict guidelines for food storage, taking this food to the oh Snap office.  Then that food is given out to students.  
What isn't eaten must be composted by our ecology and reclaimation department.

We want to make an app which pushes food info out to students in real time, and short circuit this entire process.
Anyone can push the info, you get this information with a physical location, and a timer.
