- OBJECT diagram model
- static view
- PRIORITIZED

We choose an object diagram model to show more clearly the PIECES of our application, as those pieces are the most critical portions of what we want to do.  Because we are using google maps API, we have the advantage of displaying these objects on a given background.  

Note that these objects have been PRIORITIZED by value.
MVP = minimum viable product
1 = highest priority below MVP
2..
3..
4..
5 = lowest priority, completed last.

additional note: push notifications were moved out of MVP into priority level 1.
