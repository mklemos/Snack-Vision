testing plan:
for this sprint, our goal is to have working views, models, and serializers in our django backend framework.  we should also have a UI that takes input.


unit testing:

condition: local host for Django has all methods listed as valid (post, get).
condition: django shows models, views, serializers.
condition: UI responds on all inputs.


acceptance testing:

condition: Django methods on the local host and clickable.
condition: UI operates as needed.
condition: setters and getters set and get new data to a user map.
