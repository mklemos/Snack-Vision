unit testing:


result: local host for Django has all methods listed as valid.
result: model.py shows all listed nodes.
result: UI is clickable, and you can move around the map.


acceptance testing:

result: local host for dJango successfully loads, all methods visible, data can be seen in the model.
result: UI is responsive without unexpected behavior.
FAIL: setters and getters can sometimes get lost if there are more than one of them in a short amount of time.
