client: "you guys are doing great.  i'd like to see a menu built into the UI, though.  Thanks!"

this sprint we focused on DJango and the rest api framework to create a backend that involoved an admin login with getters and setters.  

we also created a wonderful UI that is sleek and awesome looking.  Go team!
