testing plan:
for this sprint, our goal is to have working code within the android studio developer that can SHOW a pin, and load/compile correctly.


unit testing:

condition: successful compile
condition: calling FUNCTION_NAME_TEST returns true.



acceptance testing:

condition: map loads on startup.
condition: click on the map creates a pin.
